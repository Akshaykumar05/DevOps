## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a movement and a culture before being a job this is why cultural aspects are very important. DevOps is all about getting your solutions to run efficiently from deployment to updates.
The two groups, operations and development are converged into a single group where the engineers work across the whole SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).
The development team that develops the plan, designs and builds the system from scratch and the operation team for testing and implementation of whatever is developed. The operations team gave the development team feedback on any bugs that needed fixing and any rework required. Invariably, the development team would be idle awaiting feedback from the operations team. This undoubtedly extended timelines and delayed the entire software development cycle. There would be instances where the development team moves on to the next project while the operations team continues to provide feedback for the previous code. This meant weeks or even months for the project to be closed and final code to be developed. Now, what if the two departments came together and worked in collaboration with each other?
