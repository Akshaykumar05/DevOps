## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a movement and a culture before being a job this is why cultural aspects are very important. DevOps is all about getting your solutions to run efficiently from deployment to updates.
The two groups, operations and development are converged into a single group where the engineers work across the whole SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).
The development team that develops the plan, designs and builds the system from scratch and the operation team for testing and implementation of whatever is developed. The operations team gave the development team feedback on any bugs that needed fixing and any rework required. Invariably, the development team would be idle awaiting feedback from the operations team. This undoubtedly extended timelines and delayed the entire software development cycle. There would be instances where the development team moves on to the next project while the operations team continues to provide feedback for the previous code. This meant weeks or even months for the project to be closed and final code to be developed. Now, what if the two departments came together and worked in collaboration with each other?

## To become a DevOps Engineer, you need to know about:
* Linux
* Networking
* Version Control System
* Cloud Service: AWS/Azure/GCP
* Python/Bash
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* CI/CD

## Version Control System
So when you work in teams, most likely there will be some kind of version control system. It could be github, bit-bucket or gitlab. So they all work with git, which is why you need to have an understanding of it. With my personal experience, I had to learn how branching worked, how you create a pull request and what kind of git workflow the team followed. So understanding the basics of git is necessary.

### What is a Version Control System?
Version control is the ability to understand the various changes that happened to the code over time (and possibly roll back). All these are enabled by using a version control system such as Git. A Git repository can live on one’s machine, but it usually lives on a central online or on-prem repository. Benefits are:

* Collaborate with other developers
* Make sure the code is backed-up somewhere
* Make sure it’s fully viewable and auditable

You might ask why Git? Git is a de facto standard. Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. Vast numbers of developers already have Git experience and a significant proportion of college graduates may have experience with Git.
